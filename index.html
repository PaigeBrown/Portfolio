        <h2>Donnie Darko Quilt</h2>
        <h3>The Donnie Darko quilt is a down batting, queen sized quilt pieced together by hand. The ribs and words are applique. I made this quilt as an experiament to see how large scale I could work with applique and piecing. I ran into a huge number of issues, mainly that there was excessive puckering around the corners. After tweaking it several times, it finally lay flat. </h3>
