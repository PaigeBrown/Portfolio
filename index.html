      <h2>Donnie Darko Quilt</h2>
      <h3>The Donnie Darko quilt is a down batting, queen sized quilt pieced together by hand. The ribs and words are applique. I made this quilt as an experiament to see how large scale I could work with applique and piecing. I ran into a huge number of issues, mainly that there was excessive puckering around the corners. After tweaking it several times, it finally lay flat. </h3>

      <h3 class="aboutMeText">I graduated with a degree in Art Education in 2015, but decided to pursue my own art career and opened my own art business, <a href="http://www.doginalifejacket.com/">Dog in a Lifejacket Studio and Art School</a>. While this was fun, I realized that it would not pay the bills and decided to begin learning web development instead. </h3>
