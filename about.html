      <h3 class="aboutMeText">I graduated with a degree in Art Education in 2015, but decided to pursue my own art career and opened my own art business, <a href="http://www.doginalifejacket.com/">Dog in a Lifejacket Studio and Art School</a>. While this was fun, I realized that it would not pay the bills and then decided to begin learning web development instead. </h3>
